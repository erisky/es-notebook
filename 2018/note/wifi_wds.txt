1. add config

[root]

wireless.wla_multi4.ssid='wds-test'
wireless.wla_multi4.wds='1'

[leaf]
wireless.wla2.mode='sta'
wireless.wla2.ssid='wds-test'
wireless.wla2.ath_enable='1'
wireless.wla2.wds='1'

network.lan.ipaddr='192.168.1.2'

[WDS scenarios]
- Abreviation
 [R-AP] - root AP
 [L-AP] - leaf AP
 [WD]   - Wifi Dog
 [AG]   - ACP Agent

Phase I requirements:
1. AG on L-AP connects for keep
   ==> LAN side requires IP address and routing to be added for L-AP LAN side
     ==> uses dhcp is fine
2. WDS link requires a extra interface on both R-AP and L-AP
   ==> Maximun number of multiple-ssid will minus by 1 when wds is enabled.
3. WDS function is enabled manually and must be disabled by 
   ==> AG skipped any interface with option wds enabled
4. User must enable/disable wds function on R-AP and L-AP (not on AC)
   ==>
