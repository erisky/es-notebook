The biggest problem:
Do we understand the market and the product itself?
battery/environment/user scenario/how to make profit.
Positioning of this business.


2. operation
duty/person in charge is ambigious

2. PD/DCC
Sorry I have to put this first since I am RD guy.
1. The whole flow
   RMA/PPR


2. BD/Marketing
- do we have the whole plan for business?

- any market survey result?

3. RD/SD

We are not able to find the top guys.
The roadmap is not defined, the target is changing all the time.
