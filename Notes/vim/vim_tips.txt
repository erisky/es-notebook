# [change/delete internal a word] 

'ciw' -> change internal a word
'diw' -> delete 

# [use grep like function in vim]

:vimgrep /pattern/ ../**/*.c
to find the patterns in files
:cnext
:cprevious
to move between search results

short: can't not have list of rearch results
to speedup:
:noautocmd vimgrep /pattern/ ../**/*.c

# [replace a word ]
%s/old/new/icg  -> confirm by user
%s/old/new/g  -> replace globally
