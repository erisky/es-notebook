Protocol Develpoment:
- Always consider the worst case in environment
- Synchronization protocol worth notes:
  > time slot unit must be divided by the minimal slow clock. ex: 32K crystal
  > watchdog  must be used because EDs don't talk.
  > The keypoint is how to bring as much information in beacon packets
  > unicast/multicast/broadcast should be considered.
  > Confiurable network parameters
    Round interval/beacon slots/beacon slot length(ex. 200ms bcn slot and 100ms data slot)  
    latency/max nodes/power consumption expectation
  > smart queuing on the backend side should be considered. 
    ex. priority-based queue and flow control
  > multi-path does exist and dead corner is possible
  > different devices have different tx power.
    shouldn't consider you are able to recv implies you are able to send.
    --> if not able to join implies not able to find the beacon.
    A learning procedure should be implemented ex. close loop detection
    or dynamic tx power.
  > Sniffer is a MUST tool for protocol analyse tool
  > Link monitoring is the most important thing, consider it in the very early stage!!
    -> ex. AP/RT reboot should indicates 
  > uplink must be also reliable esp when it's management purpose. 
  > timestamp is a requirement
  
- Battery Powered system:
  > power budget control system
  > should have mechanism that when some devices lost beacon frequently, it should
    pause agressive retry on rejoin/tx/resend etc.
  
>> Good to have
