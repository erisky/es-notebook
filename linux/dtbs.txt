node
<name>[@<unit-address>]
name : what kind of device it represents:  ex. cpu/ethernet


* Every device node has a compatible property.




The flash node has 2 strings in the compatible property. Read on to the next section to learn why.
 As mentioned earlier, node names reflect the type of device, not the particular model. See section 2.2.2 of the ePAPR spec for a list of defined generic node names that should be used wherever possible.

ex:

        flash@2,0 {
                        compatible = "samsung,k8f1315ebm", "cfi-flash";
                                };
        }


 The first string in the list specifies the exact device that the node represents in the form "<manufacturer>,<model>". The following strings represent other devices that the device is compatible with.

Devices that are addressable use the following properties to encode address information into the device tree:
reg
#address-cells   -> how many address fields
#size-cells      -> how many length fields 

reg = <address1 length1 [address2 length2] [address3 length3] ... >
      --> Each tuple represents an address range used by the device 


cpus {
    #address-cells = <1>;
    #size-cells = <0>;
    cpu@0 {                                     # unit-address here must match the reg below
        compatible = "arm, cortex-a9"
        reg = <0>;                              # no length field since size-cell =0 
    }
}
