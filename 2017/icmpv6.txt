  > packets are exchanged only between adjacent nodes

- Router Solicitation Message - 133:
  > IPv6 nodes transmit Router Solicitation messages to ask for Router Advertisements immediately.

  > The destination address is typically the All-Router (FF02::2) multicast

- Router Advertisement Message - 134:
  > Routers send out Router Advertisement messages periodically or in response to Router Solicitation messages.
  >  source address unicast address  
  > destination address is equal either to the address of the node that solicited the message or to the All-Node multicast address (FF02::1).

- Neighbor Solicitation Message - 135:
  > IPv6 nodes transmit Neighbor Solicitation messages to request link layer addresses of Target nodes
  > source is unicast or unspecified when duplicated
  > dst to multicast addresses when a node needs to resolve an address (from IPv6 to link layer) or to unicast addresses when a node seeks to verify the reach ability of a neighbor
- Neighbor Advertisement Message - 136: 
  > a node forward Neighbor Advertisement message to propagate modifications quickly and in response to a Neighbor Solicitation message.
  > source is unicast, 
  > destination is the solicited message or all-Node (FF02::1)
- Redirect Message - 137:
  > Routers transmit Redirect messages to inform other nodes of a better first hop toward a destination.
