1. [libuv] ,[multi-thread]
    uv_write is not allowed to called from different threads, uses uv_async_send instread !!

2. [buffer handling]
    buffer handling is always an issue when sending frames through 
    pipe/socket/stream...  length handling is critcal, see acp_core:proc_req: do it a right way !
    a good library is worth of time spending

3. [Network latency]
    Service those are tested internally might not guranteed to work in cloud environment.
    should try to add an emulator mode in server / client side to emulate the latency...
    

4. [Sync]
   Do the sync to make sure
